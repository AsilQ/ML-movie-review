Clasisification of imdb movie reviews 

A complete project

The [`imdb_smol.zip`](data/imdb_smol.zip) 
contains 602 movie reviews as text files, divided into two classes :
positive and negative (materialized by subfolders). The mission is to create a
script that :

- Loads and vectorizes this data
- Trains and compares classifiers on this dataset

The objective is to determine which type of vectorization and model seems to be the most suitable and which
hyperparameters to choose.
