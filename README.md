Clasisification of imdb movie reviews 

A complete project

The [`imdb_smol.tar.gz`](data/imdb_smol.tar.gz) archive (also available [in the
repository](https://github.com/LoicGrobol/apprentissage-artificiel/blob/main/slides/06-scikit-learn/data/imdb_smol.tar.gz))
contains 602 movie reviews as text files, divided into two classes :
positive and negative (materialized by subfolders). Your mission is to create a
script that :

- Loads and vectors this data
- Trains and compares classifiers on this dataset

The objective is to determine which type of vectorization and model seems to be the most suitable and which
hyperparameters to choose.
